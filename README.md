# MS_Internship_Aug-Sept_2021

Image scrappers are extensively used in the industry today for collecting a huge number of images that are used as inputs for training the object detection/classification/identification models ...

Web scrappers are applications/bots, which automatically send requests to websites and then extract the desired information from the website output. 

In this project, we will provide a step-by-step guide for creating a web scraper, in this case, an image & text scrapper right from scratch, and then deploying it to the HEROKU cloud platform. 

We will take a simple example of an online image search and tries to explain the concepts simply, extensively, and thoroughly to create a review scrapper right from scratch and then its deployment to a cloud environment. 

 We go to a website that shows images, and then we enter the keyword to search for the photos. 
 The website shows us the images. 
 We decide to download the image(s). 

What if there is a computer program that can do all of these for us? That’s what web scrappers necessarily do. 
They try to understand the webpage content as a human would do. 

Some Examples of Web Scrapping Are : 

• Competitive Pricing
• Manufacturers monitor the market, whether the retailer is maintaining a minimum price or not. 
• Sentiment analysis of the consumers, whether they are happy with the services and products or not. 
• To aggregate news articles. 
• To aggregate Marketing data. 
• To gain financial insights from the market. 
• To gather data for research. 
• To generate marketing leads. 
And, the list goes on.
